# RQ1. What is the current state of real Android apps using native code?



Dataset

+ 3682 apps from F-Droid (F-Droid_report.txt)
+ 3549 apps from AndroZoo (2020.01 - 2022.09)



## a. Native Library usage.


|                     | F-Droid | AndroZoo |                    | F-Droid | AndroZoo |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| Total App           | 3682    | 3549     |                    |         |          |
| Has Native Method   | 808     | 2829     | /Total App         | 21.9%   | 79.7%    |
| Has .so File        | 799     | 826      | /Total App         | 21.7%   | 23.3%    |
| Has ELF in asset    | 39      | 769      | /Total App         | 1.1%    | 21.7%    |
| Has Encrypted zip   | 0       | 19       | /Total App         | -       | 0.5%     |
| Has Native Activity | 3       | 0        | /Total App         | 0.1%    | -        |
| Total Native Method | 127300  | 330477   | /Has Native Method | 157.5   | 116.8    |


Results of native library usage are presented in above Table. They indicate that 808 (i.e., 21.9%) of benign apps contain native method declarations and 799 (i.e., 21.7%) of benign apps contain at least one .so file. Regarding malware, 2829 (i.e., 79.7%) of apps contain native method declarations, and 826 (i.e., 23.3%) of apps contain at least one .so file. This means the .so file is probably downloaded at runtime or hidden under non-standard (i.e., assets) folder. We also analyzed these folder and found that 769 malware apps and 39 benign apps hide .so files in the assets folder by modifying the extension or compressing them. The most common wrong extension name we found are jar, png, zip and sdk. When decompressing zip files, we also found that some malicious apps encrypted these zip files. In addition, only a few apps used Native Activity components, so JNFuzz-Droid did not consider this situation.



## b. cpu architecture

| other          | 3       | 21       | /Total .so File | 0.4%    | 2.5%     |

overallï¼ŒARM is the most popular CPU architecture for android. among them arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a accounts for a significant proportion.



## c. native code information

To better fuzz native code, we further investigate native code information, and the experimental results are categorized into three parts. The investigation results are shown in Table below.

|                                               | **F-Droid** | **AndroZoo** |                              | **F-Driod** | **AndroZoo** |

In part A, static native methods account for 59.2% of malware and 45.3% of benign. 



**note**:  We divided them into 3 categories according to frequency and function of the parameter types: Simple type, Interactive type, and Complex types. 

+ Simple types: these include primitive types, arrays composed of elements of primitive types and string types, which can be seeded to construct parameters. 
+ Interaction types: these are used for functions such as contextual interaction and include the following seven types: android.app.Application, android.content.Context, java.lang.Object, android.content.Intent, android.app.PendingIntent, android.os.Bundle and android.app.Activity. 
+ Complex types: these include types defined by the software developer and types from third party libraries, such as Map.



In part B, on average, there are 4.8 parameters per native method in malware. Of these, 57.9% of the parameter types are simple types, 40.7% are interactive types (40.36% of which is java.lang.Object type), and 1.3% are complex types. On average, each native method in benign app has 3.1 parameters. 82.3% of them are simple types, 1.2% are interactive types, and 16.5% are complex types. Overall, the overwhelming majority (i.e., 98.6%) of native method parameter types in malware are simple and interactive. In contrast, 16.5% of native functions parameter types are complex type in benign.



Part C indicate that, in malicious apps, there are 62% of so files with static registration functions (export symbol contains: the prefix Java_) and 47% of so files with dynamic registration functions (export symbol contains: JNI_OnLoad), while in benign apps, they are 20.1% and 25.8%, respectively. This means that the benign apps are tend to reuse third-party libraries.
